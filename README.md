# Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for lung cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The LIDC-IDRI dataset is a collection of CT scan images of the lungs, which provides annotations for the presence of lung nodules.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build an accurate and reliable model that can detect lung nodules from CT scan images and classify them as cancerous or non-cancerous. Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment, and the use of deep learning algorithms can aid in the early detection process.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The LIDC-IDRI dataset will be preprocessed to ensure consistent voxel spacing, segment the lung region, and normalize pixel values. This preprocessing step is crucial for preparing the dataset for model training.

2. **Model Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be used for lung cancer detection. The model will consist of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by max pooling to reduce spatial dimensions. Fully connected layers will be used for classification, and a sigmoid activation function will be used for predicting the presence or absence of lung nodules.

3. **Training and Evaluation**: The model will be trained on a portion of the LIDC-IDRI dataset and evaluated on a separate testing set. Training techniques such as data augmentation, batch normalization, and early stopping will be employed to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Further Enhancements**: To enhance the model's performance, additional techniques such as transfer learning, ensemble learning, or more advanced architectures like 3D CNNs or attention-based models can be explored. Incorporating other clinical data or features can also be considered to improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection.
